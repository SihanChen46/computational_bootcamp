As with committing changes, we also have to specifically *push* the local repository to github. Every push ensures that the complete file set and git change database (in .git subdirectory) is mirrored at github.  As a side effect of this, of course, you now have a backup of your work. The loss of your laptop is not catastrophic, at least as far as your coursework is concerned.\n",

    "The reason to use github is that others can also access your repositories without access to your laptop hard drive. You make changes, they can *pull* those in. Someone else might also edit the code and then *push* the copy of the repository back to github and then you can *pull* those changes back to your hard drive. Everything will be in sync and it will not overwrite changes by mistake. This is how multiple programmers communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also the case that you can use github.com to work on the same software on two different computers, such as a laptop and a desktop.  Having two computers with the same software means they have copies. That introduces the possibility that you will overwrite the correct/latest version of your software. Or, you will forget that you had made changes on your laptop but have now made a bunch of changes on your desktop.  You have changes on two different computers. Resolving things can be tricky and error-prone so we use push/pull to github to keep things in sync."
