More effective ways of studying
------

1. Make and use flashcards for concepts and coding problems.
1. Take a coding problem from class or the labs solve it completely on your own by writing the code from scratch. 
    - That means to not looking at any solutions or the Internet.
    - Including fixing all errors and bugs.
    - Only after struggling and hopelessly stuck, seek advice.
    - Double check your solution is correct. Then refactor to be elegant.
1. Given a piece of code:
    1. Mental walk through it. Understand the control flow and state of all variables. Predict the outcome.
    2. Double check your intuition with Python Tutor.
    3. Start with your own code. 
    4. Then do the same with my code. I have lots of code laying around if you want more examples.
    5. Finally, look at high quality code. An example is [here](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Advent%202017.ipynb)
1. Take a concept from class and create a mind-map.
    - This is also called the Feynman Technique.
    - Double check your mind-map. Correct errors in your understanding.

Less effective ways of studying

1. Reviewing notes without taking any action.
2. Reviewing with classmates (you will be taking the quiz independently).
